#Hello world!

##
I'm pretty excited to try blogging with Jekyll and markdown. I'm pretty excited to try blogging, period. For the past year I have been thinking, planning, hoping to move back to the US from Japan. I have a great thing going here but can't help feel like I need to get back to "home," wherever exactly that is. So as a sort of resolution for 2014 I started this page.

At the same time I've been reading quite a bit about developer interview prep and a lot of advice recommends having a strong web presence. What is web presence? 

According to Gayle Laakmann McDowell of [The Google Resume](http://www.thegoogleresume.com/) a few things can help:
>* [x] Get a blog going  (one post is fine, right?)
>* [x] Github github github 
>* [x] Create a website (half-checked at the moment really)
>* [ ] Write guest blog posts
>* [ ] Answer questions on other forums


Upcoming posts should include a quick trial and error with Gist placement in Jekyll and then taking off to throwing a couple lessons a week from various interview prep courses.
