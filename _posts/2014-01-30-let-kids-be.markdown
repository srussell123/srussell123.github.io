#Let it be
<!--![alt text][bentoFeed] taken out for now-->

I was talking with a friend about our kids. I have a three year old and I break a sweat getting her to do anything. My friend has two girls, one is 3 and the other 1. He told me that he "somehow managed" to take his kids to the store at the same time. Both of them. Together.

After that we wandered into a little discussion about parenting and cultural differences between the US and Japan. Of course this is based on my own observations but below I'll outline a few key points

- Japanese parents often (typically I'd say) sleep with their kids until elementary school.
- Breast feeding is really just that.
- [Housewives][housewife] are still very common. Not only common but making lunches is [competitive as hell][superbento]. My entire facebook feed looks like the banner above -- **3 meals a day**. 
- In my experience many kids are taking lessons 4 to 5 days a week in different activities (*naraigoto*) including swimming, English, *abacus*, and music lessons. Parents will drive them to each daily until they are most of the way through elementary school. They most likely can ride bikes safely after that.

 
The above can be said to be foundational characteristcs of "average" parents in Japan. More, they are the blocks of Japanese society. Differences doesn't stop at mothers; I'd need hundreds more posts like this to even uncover the depth at which they begin.

The title of this blog post is about my first time flying back after moving here. I hadn't been home in about 2 years and in the airport in Seattle, my first layover, I saw a bunch of angry parents.

Full disclosure: I'm angry at my daughter a lot. I'm probably just storing potential anger right now. But for some reason I was shocked by what I saw. We aren't talking abuse here, just parents trying to stop their kids from running around, hoplessly redirecting their behaviors, and scolding when scolding was needed.
 
What surprised me? Well *\<plug>* upcoming blog on [reverse culture shock][reverseCultureShock] may convince you I'm not crazy*\</plug>*, I'm sure it is because I just *never see this in Japan*. I can't explain it. Somehow parents here just don't sweat the small stuff. I've been through countless nails-on-chalkboard trial lessons where a smiling mother waits out a screaming ball of annoying to hear every detail of our school's information. They leave just as they came, opening the door for their kids and walking out hand-in-hand. The kids, for their part, always say "goodbye" -- this is one of the few points where a parent might get strict. In short, wives here just ride out the tough times and it turns out just fine.

Coming around to the beginning  ...
I see a lot of FB, G+, Reddit posts about noisy kids. Nobody likes the spoiled brat ruining dinner at a decent restaurant. But when did we stop seeing kids as kids? And what parent wants their kids to have a terrible time at dinner? How did breast feeding ever become a rights issue? Honestly, where does the balance lie between *the rod* and *spoiling the child*? 

Without sounding like I have a chip on my shoulder about it, I'd just like to make the point clear. It isn't that kids just behave better in Japan -- though I do believe this, largely. It is that people understand that families are complex and difficult units; they understand that parenting is a job. Here kids and parents have a mutual respect, and people on the outside try not to fuss about each other -- even if it takes putting up with a fuss.  

In this generation's Japan it seems like the rod has been all but tossed. Will this make for mama's boy [herbivores][herbivore] or, I sure hope, some kind and industrious little (the kids) people?
