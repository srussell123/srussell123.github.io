#Testing!

##
This is just a test post to make sure that the gists will embed well into the site. While I'm at it, just better make sure that markdown syntax highlighting through [pygments](http://www.pygments.org) is fine too. Anyways ...


Here with markdown pygments:
	{% highlight cpp linenos %}
	//begin test ------------------
	int boom = 10;
	for (boom; boom > 5; boom--)
		cout << boom << ".." << endl;
	cout << " ... hmm ..." << endl;
	{% endhighlight %}

Fizzled out ... let's check it again using a gist from github:
	{% gist srussell123/79860e8ce8ecdcc5ecaf %}

Not bad, not bad. (Don't look at the line numbers!!) I'm going to have to spend some time editting the css, characters seem just a tad different between the two. For anyone interested, I'm using [jekyll-github.css](https://github.com/aahan/pygments-github-style).

So why bother with gists when Jekyll (and pygments) has me covered? 
I'm too new to Github so I don't know. Honestly...


..But as far as I can tell, gists are a convenient way to share snips of code that might otherwise be served as part of a larger file.  In preparing for interviews next year I'm going to have to run the gauntlet of data types and algorithms -- why not add the code to Github while blogging?  Exactly.

Anyway, glad they work!
