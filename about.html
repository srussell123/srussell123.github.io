					<p>I am a business owner, father, and budding developer. Right now I am pursuing a bachelor's degree (my second, as luck would have it) in Computer Science. But before I became any of those I was and ever will be <em>just.a.student</em>.</p>
					<p>In college a friend introduced me to some old movies staring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536/">Toshiro Mifune</a> and some literature from Japan. I recall now that "<em>Snow Country</em>," by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8550.Yasunari_Kawabata">Yasunari Kawabata</a>, was my first taste of the unique flavor of Japan and Japanese literature. I realized then, about midway through a degree in biochemistry, that I was dying to travel. I enrolled in a Japanese language class; it was great. I didn't have room for more so I switched my major to Anthropology and doubled up on classes. Finally in my last semester I was able to study abroad in Osaka.</p>
					<p>Seven years later I am still here. I now run a successful English school with my wife. We have a second online business in the works that should be live by summer. Our hope is that what we've accomplished here can continue long after we head back to the US later this year.</p>
					<p>On this site I will try to maintain a blog and an ongoing list of personal and professional projects. My plan this year is to continue working toward my computer science degree at <a href="http://regis.edu/CPS/Academics/Degrees-and-Programs/Undergraduate-Programs/BS-Computer-Science.aspx">Regis University</a> and, time and sanity permitting, complete a couple "bootcamp" style programming courses.</p>
					<p>Thank you and stay tuned for plenty more!</p>
