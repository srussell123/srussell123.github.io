 <div id="welcome-greeting"><h1>Welcome!</h1><p>This personal website is firmly and indefinitely a work in progress. I've been playing quite a bit with <a href="pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Eventually there will be some projects linked on the side bar and I hope to add categories and tag sortting functionality to the <a href=" {{ site.url }}/list.html">blog</a>. That said, I first have to make the blog!</p>
 <p>With any luck this website will serve as a meandering source of discussion on my technical quandries as I pursue computer science degree with a good bit of photos and stories from my years living in Japan. Thanks for stopping by.</p><hr />
